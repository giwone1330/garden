This is a temporary note to specify personal goals before starting this challenge.

I plan to complete this course within one week.
Calculations show that I have to take about 12~14 hours worth of lecture for me to reach this milestone.
I am starting at Feb 25th, and the lecture due will be Mar 2nd.

The `Machine Learning Specialization` folder within the Courses folder will have notes following the progression of the lecture.

Since I don't have much time with the one week trial, the contents can be rough and not organized.
But I later plan to organize the knowledge and concepts to move them to Notes folder.
