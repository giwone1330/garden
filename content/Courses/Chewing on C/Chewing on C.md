## Introduction
> I will be studying C with a famous Korean blogpost-ebook. It's named ["씹어먹는 C 언어"](https://modoocode.com/231). The literal meaning is chewing and eating C language.

I plan to study using the post, then document what I studied here, by translating, summarizing and organizing the content. This page will be the hub or table of contents for each chapters.
