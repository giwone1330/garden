## Abstract
Municipalities and governmental agencies continue to mainly rely on responsive treatments such as road resurfacing or reconstruction which are costly. This study found that there is a knowledge gap about the long-term economic benefits of preventive treatments at the road network level. To address this knowledge gap, the present study presents a long-term, lifecycle economic feasibility analysis of implementing preventive treatments for a municipal highway. This paper examines three main aspects: (1) the effectiveness of preventive maintenance treatments, (2) the degree of cost reduction associated with different types of preventive treatments, and (3) the extent of preventive treatment required to achieve the desired effect. The analysis reveals that combining preventive maintenance with rehabilitation treatments can lead to a significant 28% reduction in total costs over a 30-year period, regardless of the type of preventive action taken.
