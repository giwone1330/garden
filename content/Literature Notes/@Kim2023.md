## Abstract
Although computer vision technology has shown great potential, its reliability can significantly degrade in the target domain where the model is applied. Collecting and labeling training data from the target domain can address this issue, however it is a tedious and timeconsuming. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel method generating training data for construction site monitoring. The proposed method consists of extracting moving objects, classifying each region by comparing their features to the target classes, and then assigning class labels. The newly labeled data is copied and pasted to a clear background of the target domain where its foregrounds are removed by image inpainting. Experiments were conducted on construction site videos captured in far-field monitoring environments. The proposed method can significantly reduce the amount of effort required for data collection and labeling, thereby increasing the efficiency of developing robust computer vision models for construction site monitoring.
