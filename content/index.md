Hello everyone!
I am [[Giwon Shin]], and this is my digital garden.

I created this space with several purposes in mind, including:

- Personal Notes
- Learning in Public
- Portfolio Building

To achieve those goals, I am planning to write contents regarding my:

- Studies
- Ideas
- Projects
- Experiences

I am quite new to both Obsidian and digital note-taking practices at the moment, so it might take some time to get used to. Bear with me!

All that aside, I will do my best to update regularly with moderately polished contents!
