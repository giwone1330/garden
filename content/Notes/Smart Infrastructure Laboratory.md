## [Smart Infrastructure Laboratory](https://hongjo.github.io/)
I was a research assistant at [Smart Infrastructure Laboratory](https://hongjo.github.io/) (SIL), Yonsei University, where I participated in various research projects.
I worked from Feb.2022 to Nov. 2023, full time during the summer and winter breaks, and part time for spring and fall semesters.
I have learned much about academic research and applications of artificial intelligence to industrial domains.

### Projects 
[[Visionâ€‘based safety securing technology for temporary structure installation and dismantlement]]
[[Development of smart safety assurance technology for temporary structures]]
[[Mobile robot based PPE compliance monitoring]]
[[Overcoming the limitations for AI based construction site monitoring]]
[[Developing the foundation for participatory sensing in infrastructure monitoring]]
[[Smart response system for urban disaster and health resilience under climate change]]
[[Vision-based pavement condition assessment for automated maintenance and repair decision-making]]
