## [Smart Infrastructure Laboratory](https://hongjo.github.io/)
I was a research assistant at [Smart Infrastructure Laboratory](https://hongjo.github.io/) (SIL), Yonsei University, where I participated in various research projects.
I worked from Feb.2022 to Nov. 2023, full time during the summer and winter breaks, and part time for spring and fall semesters.
I have learned much about academic research and applications of artificial intelligence to industrial domains.
