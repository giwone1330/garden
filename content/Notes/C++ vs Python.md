## Programming Language for PS
To the best of my knowledge, the language of choice for PS has become less confined to C or C++ than before. In fact, with the recent boom of AI and Machine Learning which is often powered by Python, many companies accept python for their coding problems and interviews. However, when you compare the runtime for the same solution in python and C++, the gap is incomparable. In most cases, the judge knows this innate speed deficiency, and sets the time limit for python to be more forgiving than other languages such as C++.

In conclusion, you can choose whichever language you are comfortable with, but know that there will be some edge cases that will be beneficial to C or C++.
